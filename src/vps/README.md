These codes are all based on https://github.com/Nanne/pytorch-NetVlad .

We use their open source code as very initial example code for VPS of DeepGuider.

After some step, we could make and release our own VPS code.



```
cd netvlad

# If it's first time to visit here after a git clone, run setup as follows:
./0setup_env.sh

# If you want to run test with pre-trained weight
./3run_test_pitt256k.sh

# If you want to run train
./1run_train.sh

```



Please refer to [**./netvlad/README.md**](netvlad/README.md) to proceed in details.
